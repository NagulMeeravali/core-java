Topic-4: File handling using ByteStreams:
------------------------------------------
1. Write a Java program to get a list of all file/directory names from the given using File class object.

2. Write a Java program to read data from input file and convert into uppercase then write data into output file using FileInputStream and FileOutputStream classes. Handle IOException while reading and writing data.
Input:Create text file and write some data to the file. Sample data: "Hi, this is Sample data"

Sample output: HI, THIS IS SAMPLE DATA

3. Write a Java program to read data from input file and convert all the characters into swapcase then write into output file using FileInputStream and FileOutputStream classes.

Input:Create text file and write some data to the file. Sample data: "Hi, This is Sample data"
Output: hI,tHIS IS sAMPLE DATA

4. Write a java program to count the list of files based their extension using File class. display following files count on console. 
   ==> Number of text files
   ==> Number of document files
   ==> Number of image files
   ==> Number of other files

Input: Create folder and create different files such as document,pdf,image and text files.

    Number of document files :3
    Number of image files    :4
    Number of other files    :3

5. Write a Java program to accept directory name, file name from user. do the following steps using File class.
==>create directory with user entered direcory name
==>Create file in given directory.
==> accept one sentence about bitLabs and store in give file using FileOutputStream class.
==> Read data from given file and display read data on console using FileInputStream class.

Topic-5: File handling using character streams:
-------------------------------------------------
1. Write a Java program to print list of repeated words and list of non-repeated words in a given file.and print number of repeated words and number of non=repeated words.
input: Create text file and write some data to the file.

output:
   Repeated words: 
                 // Display all words which are repeating
   Number of repeated words: 33
   Non-Reapeated Words: 
                 // Display all words which are not repeating
   Number of  repeated words: 12

2. Write a program to read data from a file and find the frequency of each word in a file. and print each word along with frequency in sorted order.


input: Create text file and write some data to the file.

Output:

      word 1: top frequency
            :
            :
            :
      Word n:  least frequency

3. Write a Java program to find the longest word and smallest word in a text file.

Input: Create text file and write some data to the file. Sample data: "Welcome to bitLabs"

Ouput: 

Longest word: Welcome
Smallest word: to

4. Write a Java program to read data from input file and find word count in each line and logest word in each line. handle IOException while reading data from input file.
Input: Create text file and write some data to the file.
Expected Output:
Number of words in line number1: 4 and logest word is: "     "  (Print logest word in first line)
'
'
'
Number of words in line number n: 7 and logest word is: "     "  (Print logest word in last line)

5. Write a Java program accept 5 students details such as name and marks and store in studentdetails.txt file in below format
     Ramu, 60
     Kumar,56
     Rakesh,89
     Suresh,66
